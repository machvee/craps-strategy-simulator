Inputs player strategy can reference (and how they can help shape a strategy)

1. whats the table state?  off on (point)
     "if table is off I want to make a pass line bet, but not a come bet"
2. what player bets are on the table
     "I don't have a place 6/8 bet"  "I already have a pass odds bet"
3. how much is bet on each
     "how much do I have on place 5, I want to stop pressing it so high"
4. outcome of last roll
     "won hard 8, place 8, lost Field bet"
5. consecutive win/lost streak of each table bet +2 = 2 wins, -3 = 3 losses
     "wow, the place 5 bet just hit 3 times, and I'm not on it"
6. consecutive win/lost streak of each player bet +2 = 2 wins, -3 = 3 losses
     "my hard 8 just lost 3 in a row, I think I'll stay off of it"
     "I just won my 4th point in a row.  Table is HOT!  Start Pressing!"
7. current rail win/losses (% up/down)
     "I'm down 50%.  I think I'll quit"
8. number of rolls
     "I will do 500 rolls and stop to see where I'm at"
