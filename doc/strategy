Inputs player strategy can reference (and how they can help shape a strategy)

1. whats the table state?  off on (point)
     "if table is off I want to make a pass line bet, but not a come bet"
2. what player bets are on the table
     "I don't have a place 6/8 bet"  "I already have a pass odds bet"
3. how much is bet on each
     "how much do I have on place 5, I want to stop pressing it so high"
4. outcome of last roll
     "won hard 8, place 8, lost Field bet"
5. consecutive win/lost streak of each table bet +2 = 2 wins, -3 = 3 losses
     "wow, the place 5 bet just hit 3 times, and I'm not on it"
6. consecutive win/lost streak of each player bet +2 = 2 wins, -3 = 3 losses
     "my hard 8 just lost 3 in a row, I think I'll stay off of it"
     "I just won my 4th point in a row.  Table is HOT!  Start Pressing!"
7. current rail win/losses (% up/down)
     "I'm down 50%.  I think I'll quit"
8. number of rolls
     "I will do 500 rolls and stop to see where I'm at"


Testing out Strategies

1. Define your strategy by programming a bot.  give the strategy and run a unique name.
2. clear the stats
3. define stop criteria 
  a. shooter_turns n
  b. play points n
  c. num rolls of dice
  d. player acct up/down % (or goes bust)
4. stops at n, when other bot criteria makes the round stop
5. seed and player/table stats can be saved, so this exact dice sequence can be replayed
   with slightly different strategy

Bet Makers and PassLine and Come Out bets

  1.  Bet makers are responsible only for making the Passline bet and a come Out bet at the appropriate times.
      The table play will Morph these bets into numbered bets.  The pass_line bet won't get remade because the 
      table is on.  The come out bets *will be remade because the table in on.

  2.  So BetMakers are good for PassLine and Come Out.  If number of bets on table is important for a bet_maker rule
      ComeBets will be counted, not Come Out.

  3.  BetMaker stats should account for the morph bets winnings/losing when tabulating

  4.  Odds bets need to be made if odds multiples are specified in PassLine and ComeOut Bets.  Its not easy to know who
      is responsible for making these bets.  The BetMakers are no longer in scope when the point gets set or a come out
      bet is morphed to a numbered bet.  Odds bet win/loss stats should be tied to the bet_maker that made the original
      passline or comeout bet.
