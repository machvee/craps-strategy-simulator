Craps Bots

  1. Background

  A bot has an objective.  A mission.  In the case of Vegas games the mission is to maximize gains and minimize losses.
  When the conditions are right, the bot should act to take full advantage.   When times are going rough, the bot should
  hunker down and protect.

  The bot is programmed to carry out the objective.  These are the bot's mission instructions.   But the bot is only as good as 
  its programming.

  2. Programming the Bot

  The bot has two programming languages.  One language is for people who want the bot to carry out the mission and achieve
  the objective. This language is in terms of how people understand and appraoch the game.   The other is the machine language
  of the bot... the language of the instructions the bot actually understands and can process effeciently.  An
  interpreter program will translate the program that people write into the instructions that be bot will actually process. 
  
  As there are many ways to play Vegas games, each person will have their own style, risk tolerance and aggressive or
  conservative appraoch.  The goal of whaleamker is to capture these bot programs and give feedback on how the bot 
  strategy works.  The bot programs are stored with their results and can be compared with other bot strategies for 
  effectiveness.
